Abstract

Much experimental evidence shows that minimally counterintuitive concepts, which violate one intuitive ontological expectation of domain-specific natural kinds, are remembered as well as or better than intuitive concepts with no violations of ontological expectations, and much better than maximally counterintuitive concepts with more than one violation of ontological violations (Barrett and Nyhoff, 2001; Boyer and Ramble, 2001; Atran and Norenzayan, 2004; Gonce et al., 2006). It is also well established that concepts rated as high in imagery, (e.g., apple) are recalled better than concepts that are low in imagery (e.g., justice; see Paivio, 1990). We conducted three studies to test whether imagery levels affected recall rates of intuitive, minimally counterintuitive, and maximally counterintuitive concepts. In study 1, we obtained imagery level ratings for 48 three-word items. In study 2, we used the ratings obtained in study 1 in a 2 × 3 recall task in which imagery (high vs. low) was manipulated along with counterintutiveness (intuitive vs. minimally counterintuitive vs. maximally counterintuitive). High imagery items were recalled significantly better than low imagery items for intuitive and maximally counterintuitive items but not for minimally counterintuitive items. Study 3, replicated the findings from study 2 in a 2 × 2 study using a larger number of intuitive and minimally counterintuitive items. In both studies, High imagery items were recalled significantly better than low imagery items for intuitive but not for minimally counterintuitive items. Thus, minimally counterintuitive concepts appear insulated from imagery effects on recall.

Ethnographic and historical studies reveal that certain types of concepts recur across human cultures with regularity. For example, all human cultures possess artwork, narrative tales and religion having some similar characteristics (Brown, 1991). The recurrence of such cultural forms raises two empirical questions. First, what are the cognitive mechanisms involved in the produc- tion and transmission of such recurrent cultural concepts? Second, what con- ceptual structures do such concepts possess that make them fit for cognitive consumption?
Recent work seeking to answer these questions has focused primarily on the constraints placed on the transmission, actual and potential, of cultural con- cepts by the domain-specificity of our cognitive architecture. (see Hirschfeld and Gelman, 1994) According to this view, people have an “intuitive ontol- ogy” with representational information about what things in the world are like. For example, our “folk physics” system allows us to gauge trajectories of moving objects and to infer that moving solid objects will “launch” stationary solid objects when struck at impact. (McCloskey, 1983; diSessa et al., 2004) Similarly, our “folk biology” system informs our understanding of plants and of animals (Medin and Atran, 2004), “folk psychology” informs our under- standing of agents’ thoughts and actions (Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1997), and “folk sociology” informs our understanding of members of in- or out-groups. (Hirschfeld, 1996).
The tacit information contained in these cognitive systems enables us to generate domain-level inferential expectations about the functioning of vari- ous objects. At the domain level, we expect humans to be different from ani- mals, animals to be different from plants, plants to be different from natural objects, and natural objects to be different from artifacts. At the kind-level, we expect dogs to be different from snakes and spiders. Thus object recognition involves categorizing an object-kind into one of the five domains, which in turn triggers intuitive ontological expectations about the properties of that object. (Boyer, 1994).
However, our intuitive ontology is neither perfectly accurate in its represen- tations of what objects in the world are like nor is it completely inflexible. Thus, as diSessa, et al. (2004) argued, there are important inconsistencies in individuals’ use of the naïve concepts of force; objects in the world can (and do) violate our intuitive expectations, as in illusions. Objects that violate our intuitive expectations, as well as concepts and schemata involving such objects, are thus distinctive and “stand out” cognitively. In turn, the distinctiveness of counterintuitive concepts, i.e., those that possess violations of intuitive expec- tations, makes them “cognitively optimal” for employment in cultural narra- tives because their distinctiveness makes them attention-grabbing – a fact that magicians, advertisers, and novelists (among others) exploit with regularity. In fact, the imaginative construction of stories often relies upon counterintuitive concepts, as in science fiction, fantasy stories and religious myths (Tweney et al., data not shown).
Not all counterintuitive concepts are equally likely to be transmitted across cultures, however. The types of concepts that might be best fit for cultural transmission are minimally counterintuitive (MCI) concepts, i.e., concepts that violate only one or two intuitive expectations. MCI concepts achieve a cognitive optimum by being non-natural (or, in the case of religion, “super- natural”) but learnable, i.e., distinctive but still easy enough to represent, pro- cess and code in memory by maintaining the remaining inferential expectations natural kinds possess. Thus, a “sobbing oak” is cognitively optimal for cultural transmission because it violates only one expectation about oak trees (they do not sob).
Experimental studies over the past two decades indirectly support the MCI hypothesis, showing that expectation-violating stimuli are better remembered than non-expectation-violating stimuli. (Schmidt, 1985; Hirshman et al., 1989; Hunt, 1995; Waddill and McDaniel, 1998) More recent and direct studies of the MCI hypothesis have obtained further support. Barrett and Nyhof (2001) conducted narrative recall studies using serial reproduction (Bartlett 1932), free recall, and delayed free recall tasks that used three types of concepts – intuitive concepts (INT) that did not violate any category-level ontological intuitive expectations (e.g., a member of a species that has two biological parents), MCI concepts that violated one or two category-level intuitive expectations about natural kinds (e.g., a carrot that screams “Stop!” when you are about to eat it), and bizarre (BIZ) concepts that did not violate category-level intuitive ontological expectations about natural kinds, even while being unusual (e.g., a person that weighs 500 lbs). Each type of concept was embedded in stories told to or read by subjects. Overall, Barrett and Nyhof found that MCI concepts from the stories were recalled better than either INT or BIZ concepts in both immediate and delayed tasks.
Similarly, Boyer and Ramble (2001) used modified versions of the Barrett and Nyhof stories with subjects in France, and later in replications carried out in Gabon and Nepal. Like Barrett and Nyhof, Boyer and Ramble found that MCI concepts were recalled better than intuitive concepts, as well as better than maximally counterintuitive concepts (MXCI) that violated numerous intuitive expectations.
In a third study of the MCI hypothesis, however, Atran and colleagues found that INT concepts were recalled better than MCI concepts and MXCI items concepts when concepts are presented to subjects as lists rather than as embedded in narratives. (Atran and Norenzayan, 2004) To resolve these dis- parate findings, Gonce et al. (2006) conducted studies which confirmed that when presented in stories MCI concepts are recalled better than INT and MXCI concepts, but when presented as lists INT concepts are recalled better than MCI and MXCI concepts. In both cases, however, the differences in recall between INT and MCI were small, especially compared to the large recall deficit when MXCI concepts were presented.

Imagery Effects on Counterintuitive Concept Recall

One feature of the four sets of studies on the MCI hypothesis is that regardless of whether presented as lists or in narratives that provide context, MXCI con- cepts are very poorly recalled compared to both INT and MCI concepts. Boyer’s explanation for this fact is that MXCI concepts lack “inferential poten- tial” because possessing numerous violations makes it difficult for individuals to categorize the concepts into natural domains which trigger representational information about the concepts. Because MXCI concepts are not easily cate- gorized, they cannot be represented, processed, and recorded in memory for later recall.
While the empirical evidence supports the claim that MXCI concepts are harder to recall than INT or MCI concepts, an alternative to Boyer’s “inferen- tial potential” explanation is possible based on the empirical work of Paivio and his colleagues (see Paivio 1990). Paivio and colleagues have shown that memorability is strongly correlated with a concept’s imagery level. Concepts that are high in imagery (i.e., that are easy to image) are almost always recalled better than concepts that are low in imagery, e.g., “apple” is high imagery, “justice” is low and, therefore, “apple” is recalled better than “justice”.
Based on this fact, we hypothesized that MXCI concepts are harder to recall because they are more difficult to image than INT or MCI concepts. In other words, since imagery is a great memory facilitator, we wanted to see how it combined with intuitiveness. We conducted 3 studies to test this claim. In study 1, we gathered imagery ratings for 48 three-word items. Using imagery ratings gathered in study 1, in study 2 we used a 2×3 recall task in which imagery (high vs. low) was manipulated along with counterintutiveness (intu- itive vs. minimally counterintuitive vs. maximally counterintuitive). Finally, in study 3, we replicated the findings from study 2 in a 2×2 study using a larger number of intuitive and minimally counterintuitive items.

Studies

Study 1

Participants

Participants were 83 students from the University of Findlay currently enrolled in one of the following classes: Introduction to Religion (2 sections), Psychol- ogy of Religion, or Religions of India and Tibet. There were 61 females and 23 males, with a mean age of 20.55.

Method

Participants were asked to rate the imagery levels of 48 three-word items (e.g., wandering jumping deer, meowing furry cat). Subjects were shown items one at a time in the format of PowerPoint slides. They were given 10 seconds to rate how easy it was to generate an image of the item on a 7-point scale where easy to image items were rated 7 and hard to image items were rated 1. Mean scores and standard deviations were then analyzed for item imagery level rat- ings and items were given a designation of “high imagery” or “low imagery” based on those ratings. Items were classified as High or Low in imagery based on a median split of the ratings.

Materials

Order of presentation was counterbalanced in each class. 17 of the three-word items were INT concepts, 13 were MCI concepts and 18 were MXCI con- cepts (e.g., INT, crumbling ancient marble; MCI, sobbing tall oak; MXCI, chanting grazing TV).

Results

Results of the imagery ratings per item are summarized in Table 1. Mean imagery ratings by item type were INT=5.29, MCI=4.14 and MXCI=3.48. These scores are represented graphically in Fig. 1.

Discussion

Intuitive items were easier for participants to image than both minimally and maximally counterintuitive items, and minimally counterintuitive items were easier to image than maximally counterintuitive items; INT > MCI > MXCI. These ratings might explain the findings by Atran and Norenzayan (not shown) that intuitive items were recalled better than minimally and maxi- mally counter-intuitive items, and that minimally counterintuitive items were recalled better than maximally counterintuitive items, given that the items were presented as lists in both studies rather than in stories that provide context. (see Gonce et al., 2006).
Importantly, the ratings also demonstrate that there are large variances of imagery levels across item types. Some intuitive items were rated as high in imagery while other intuitive items were rated as low in imagery. The same held true for minimally counterintuitive items and for maximally counterin- tuitive items. As such, these findings enabled us to construct a 2×3 recall study, in which we could manipulate the variables of imagery and counterintuitive- ness in 6 item types: Intuitive-Low Imagery, Intuitive-High Imagery, Mini- mally Counterintuitive-Low Imagery, Minimally Counterintuitive-High Imagery, Maximally Counterintuitive-Low Imagery, and Maximally Counterintuitive- High Imagery.

Study 2

Participants

A total of 48 participants from the University of Findlay psychology class participated in this study. They were given extra credit toward their course grade for participating.

Method

A 2 (imagery)×3 (intuitiveness) design was used, with all participants seeing all types of items.

Materials

Packets were made consisting of instructions, a list with 12 items per packet, simple arithmetic problems as distraction tasks, and a recall sheet. The list contained two items of each of the following kinds: maximally counterintuitive- high imagery, maximally counterintuitive-low imagery, minimally counterintui- tive-high imagery, minimally counterintuitive-low imagery, intuitive-high imagery and intuitive-low imagery. There were four packets total, each exist- ing in two forms that presented the items counterbalanced in two different random orders. A total of 48 items were used.

Procedure

Participants were given the packets and instructed not to look ahead in the packet until told to do so. The first sheet of instructions was read aloud and informed them that this was a memory study and that they would be asked to recall items. Then participants were told to turn the page and read and study the list of items. After 3 minutes they were instructed to turn to the next page and begin doing the math problems. After one minute, participants were instructed to turn to the next page of the packet and to write down as many of the items from the initial list as they could remember. After 3 minutes, participants were told to stop and hand in their packets. They were thanked for their participation and told the purpose of the study.

Results

The results are shown in Fig. 2. A 3 (item type, MXCI, MCI, INT)×2 (imag- ery level, high, low) within-subjects ANOVA was conducted. Analysis revealed a main effect of item type, F(2,92)=6.349, p=0.003 and a main effect of imag- ery, F(1,46)=8.170, p=0.006. The interaction between item type and imagery approached significance, F(2,92)=2.597, p=0.080.

Discussion

The results are consistent with previous findings that maximally counterintui- tive items have the lowest recall. We predicted that imagery would have an effect on recall with high imagery items having higher recall than low imagery items. This is what we found with the maximally counterintuitive items and intuitive items. However, the minimally counterintuitive items were not affected by imagery. There was very little difference between recall for high imagery minimally counterintuitive items and low imagery minimally counterintuitive items. This finding is not consistent with Paivio’s findings of high imagery items being recalled better than low imagery items. However, this result does help support the idea that there is something unique about minimally coun- terintuitive items. These items may be “resistant” to imagery effects and there- fore in a class of their own. In order to investigate this claim further we conducted Study 3 to replicate the findings of Study 2 using a larger number of items in each condition.

Study 3

Participants

Participants were 56 Bowling Green State University students enrolled in an Introductory Psychology course. They received extra credit for their participation.

Method

A 2 (imagery level)×2 (counterintuitiveness) design was used. Each participant saw each type of item.

Materials

Packets were made as in Study 2 consisting of instructions, a list of items, math problems and a recall sheet. The 1ist of 12 items consisted of three items of each of the following kinds: minimally counterintuitive-high imagery, min- imally counterintuitive-low imagery, intuitive-high imagery and intuitive-low imagery. No maximally counterintuitive items were chosen because the focus was on how the recall of intuitive and minimally counterintuitive items is influenced by imagery. There were two packets each existing in two forms that presented the items in two different orders.

Procedure

The procedure was identical to that of Study 2.

Results

The results are shown in Fig. 3. A 2 (item type, MCI, INT)×2 (imagery level, high, low) within-subjects ANOVA was conducted. There was no main effect of item type, F(1,54)=0.260, p=ns, which was expected since recall of intuitive and minimally counterintuitive items has been shown to be similar. There was a significant main effect of imagery, F(1,54)=31.766, p<0.001and a significant interaction of item type and imagery, F(1,54)=19.565, p<0.001.

Discussion

The results replicated those of Study 2. We predicted that imagery would have an effect on recall with high imagery items having higher recall than low imagery items. This is what we found with intuitive items. However, the minimally coun- terintuitive items were not affected by imagery. There was very little difference between recall for high imagery minimally counterintuitive items and low imagery minimally counterintuitive items. Again, this finding is not consis- tent with Paivio’s findings of high imagery items being recalled better than low imagery items. This result helps to support the idea that there is something unique about minimally counterintuitive items. These items may be “resis- tant” to imagery effects and therefore in a class of their own.

General Discussion

It appears that minimally counterintuitive items are resilient to imagery effects unlike maximally counterintuitive and intuitive items. Moreover, though pre- vious studies have shown that intuitive and minimally counterintuitive items are sometimes equally well recalled, we have found that the level of imagery associated with those items will significantly affect recall especially when imag- ery is low. Part of the interest of these results comes from the fact that they are inconsistent with the widely replicated findings of Paivio and colleagues in which low imagery items are always recalled poorly compared to high imagery items.
The results are also relevant to the argument that the minimally counterin- tuitive hypothesis helps to explain the prevalence of religious belief across cul- tures. Since supernatural concepts are frequently low in imagery, sometimes by definition (e.g., an “invisible god”), the finding that such concepts can still enjoy a memory advantage is potentially important. Some religious concepts are, of course, high in imagery (e.g., the American Indian “Coyote Trickster,” the “Bleeding Heart of Jesus”). Our results suggest a possible cognitive reason for this distinction, one that enhances the power of the minimal counterintu- itiveness hypothesis.
Furthermore, Barrett (1999) and Slone (2004) have argued that the preva- lence of “theological incorrectness” across religious systems can be explained in terms of cognitive optimality. In short, lay religious practitioners tend to have theologically incorrect “folk” beliefs (e.g., “God is a big guy in the sky” vs. “God is an omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient essence”) because theologically correct concepts are maximally counterintuitive and, therefore, overly cognitively burdensome to employ in everyday online thinking. It may be that the significant lack of imagibility among maximally counterintuitive items condemns such concepts to mnemic oblivion, thus requiring special institutions (e.g., seminaries) and external memory aids (e.g., texts) for suc- cessful cultural transmission.
